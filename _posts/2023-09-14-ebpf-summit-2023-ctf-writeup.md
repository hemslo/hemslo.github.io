  Summary of the eBPF Summit 2023 CTF where participants needed to identify
  and kill a specific process reading /etc/passwd to reveal a flag.
---

## 0x00 Introduction

This is the writeup for eBPF Summit 2023 CTF.
The challenge details can be found [here](https://github.com/isovalent/eBPF-Summit-2023-CTF).
The environment is a Ubuntu 22.04 VM.

The goal is to find the process that is reading `/etc/passwd`,
kill that process then the flag will be revealed at `/ebpf.summit`.

## 0x01 Information Gathering

All commands are executed as `root`.

Check current `/ebpf.summit` content :

```shell
cat /ebpf.summit
```

```text
I've been in your kernel for [22.109948 seconds]
```

Check which process is reading `/etc/passwd` :

```shell
lsof /etc/passwd
```

No output, either the process is not holding the fd or it's invisible.

Check if the process in provision is still running:

```shell
ps aux | grep ebpf
```

```text
root       12474  0.0  0.0   6420  1844 pts/1    S+   08:10   0:00 grep --color=auto ebpf
```

Nope, can't find anything.

To monitor it in real time, we can use traditional tools like `inotifywait` or `fatrace`.
But since this is an eBPF challenge, let's use some eBPF tools.

Usually [BCC](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) or [bpftrace](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace)
are my first choice since they are easy to use and have a lot of examples.
In this environment, [Tetragon](https://tetragon.cilium.io/) is also pre-installed, another great tool.
And `bpftool` to further investigate the eBPF programs.

Install tools first:

```shell
apt install bpftrace bpfcc-tools linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

Check which process is opening `/etc/passwd` using `opensnoop`:

```shell
opensnoop-bpfcc | grep "/etc/passwd"
```

```text
2372   ebpf.summit.202    18   0 /etc/passwd
```

Or a one line `bpftrace` script:

```shell
bpftrace -e 'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_openat /str(args->filename) == "/etc/passwd"/ { printf("%d %s \n", pid, comm); }'
```

```text
Attaching 1 probe...
2372 ebpf.summit.202
```

## 0x02 Exploit

Kill the process

```shell
kill 2372
```

Check the flag

```shell
cat /ebpf.summit
```

```text
You purged the computers of the malware - and not a second too late. Congratula
tions! The location of the base remains a secret. Maybe not for long though, wh
ile everyone was focusing on the computers, Bajeroff Lake, the traitor, managed
 to escape from his cell and stole a shuttle to escape the base. On the radars,
you only see him jump into hyperspace. There's no doubt your paths will cross a
gain one day. Before that, you'll take a day or three off to enjoy a well-deser
ved rest. How about checking in on your giant bees, for a change?

Oh wait, they're just calling all hands on deck: a Rebel squadron fell into an
ambush and is fighting their way out... You'll relax another week!

Thanks for playing the eBPF Summit 2023 Capture the Flag, paste the below code
in the CTF channel on the eBPF Slack!

GJ4xMFOoFRSFES5XFFq7MFO8LKZtnJ9trJ46pvOeMKWhMJjtMz4lVSf0Zl9mZwtmBQLtp7Iwo70xp65X
```

The same method can be used for both easy and hard mode, I haven't checked their differences yet.

Update: Revealed in [eCHO Episode 107: eBPF Summit CTF Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYeRuRtI55M).
Easy mode can expose pid in system log

```shell
$ dmesg
[  523.951058] ebpf.summit.202[3385] is installing a program with bpf_probe_write_user helper that may corrupt user memory!
```

While hard mode will clear system log.

I actually solved it before the event started so I can focus on summit talks.
However, when approaching to the end of the event, I saw a message from host:

```text
For glory points, has anyone cracked the code? 
```

What? That code has some hidden meanings?

It looks like a base64 string, but decode result doesn't make any sense.

It's 5 AM, too tired to do cryptography analysis, so I took a shortcut, reverse engineer the challenge binary.

Load [binary](https://github.com/isovalent/eBPF-Summit-2023-CTF/tree/main/bin) into my favorite RE tool [Cutter](https://cutter.re/),
use `Ghidra` to decompile the `main` function.

```c
            auVar19 = runtime.stringtoslicebyte
                                ((int64_t)&stack0xfffffffffffffd78, auVar19._0_8_, iVar14, arg_8h, arg_10h, 
                                 in_stack_fffffffffffffca8);
            auVar19 = encoding/base64.(*Encoding).EncodeToString
                                (_encoding/base64.StdEncoding, auVar19._0_8_, auVar19._8_8_, iVar14, arg_8h, arg_10h, 
                                 in_stack_fffffffffffffca8, arg_20h);
            auVar19 = main.rot13rot5(auVar19._0_8_, auVar19._8_8_, arg_8h, arg_10h);
```

Ok, the flag is encoded by `base64` then `rot13rot5` ([rot18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13#Variants)).

To decode it, can use online decoders, or life is short, use python:

```python
import string
import base64

rot18 = str.maketrans(
    {
        c: string.ascii_lowercase[i - 13] for i, c in enumerate(string.ascii_lowercase)
    } | {
        c: string.ascii_uppercase[i - 13] for i, c in enumerate(string.ascii_uppercase)
    } | {
        c: string.digits[i - 5] for i, c in enumerate(string.digits)
    }
)


def decode(s):
    return base64.b64decode(s.translate(rot18)).decode()
```

```python
>>> decode('GJ4xMFOoFRSFES5XFFq7MFO8LKZtnJ9trJ46pvOeMKWhMJjtMz4lVSf0Zl9mZwtmBQLtp7Iwo70xp65X')
"Mode [HARD]\nI've was in your kernel for [93.328386 seconds]\n"
```

Knowing how itâ€™s generated, I can craft an impossible but valid flag:

```python
def encode(s):
    return base64.b64encode(s.encode()).decode().translate(rot18)
```

```python
>>> encode("Mode [HARD]\nI've was in your kernel for [0.000000 seconds]\n")
'GJ4xMFOoFRSFES5XFFq7MFO8LKZtnJ9trJ46pvOeMKWhMJjtMz4lVSfjYwNjZQNjZPOmMJAiozEmKDb='
```

On second thought, is there a way to achieve the impossible without cheating?

How to kill the process when it's accessing `/etc/passwd`?
It's doable with eBPF, one handy tool is `Tetragon`.
Can use a similar policy like [Synchronously stopping the process](https://tetragon.cilium.io/docs/getting-started/try-tetragon-linux/#synchronously-stopping-the-process).

```yaml
apiVersion: cilium.io/v1alpha1
kind: TracingPolicy
metadata:
  name: "kill-passwd-access"
spec:
  kprobes:
  - call: "sys_openat"
    syscall: true
    args:
    - index: 0
      type: "int"
    - index: 1
      type: "string"
    selectors:
    - matchArgs:
      - index: 1
        operator: "Equal"
        values:
        - "/etc/passwd\0"
      matchActions:
      - action: Signal
        argSig: 15
 ```

Start tetragon with this policy:

```shell
tetragon --tracing-policy tracing_policy.yaml
```

Then start the challenge:

```shell
HARDMODE=true /tmp/ebpf.summit.2023
```

Check the flag in `/ebpf.summit`:

```text
GJ4xMFOoFRSFES5XFFq7MFO8LKZtnJ9trJ46pvOeMKWhMJjtMz4lVSfjYwNjZQN8APOmMJAiozEmKDb=
```

Decode:

```python
>>> decode('GJ4xMFOoFRSFES5XFFq7MFO8LKZtnJ9trJ46pvOeMKWhMJjtMz4lVSfjYwNjZQN8APOmMJAiozEmKDb=')
"Mode [HARD]\nI've was in your kernel for [0.000074 seconds]\n"
```

That's close enough!

## 0x03 Additional Analysis

One thing about this challenge is that process is not visible in `ps` output, otherwise it's too easy to find and kill.
How is this achieved?

Hide a process is not a new trick, for example [libprocesshider](https://github.com/gianlucaborello/libprocesshider).
eBPF offensive capabilities are also getting more attention,
like [bad-bpf](https://github.com/pathtofile/bad-bpf) or [boopkit](https://github.com/krisnova/boopkit).

`getdents` can be hooked to hide a process, example [Pid-Hide](https://github.com/pathtofile/bad-bpf#pid-hide).

To see if this is the case, check the eBPF programs:

```shell
bpftool prog show
```

There are some matching ones:

```text
27: tracepoint  name handle_getdents  tag 5fa666123368aa3b  gpl
        loaded_at 2023-09-14T13:55:09+0000  uid 0
        xlated 296B  jited 173B  memlock 4096B  map_ids 37,38
        btf_id 100
28: tracepoint  name handle_getdents  tag 3da1705dc803ad56  gpl
        loaded_at 2023-09-14T13:55:09+0000  uid 0
        xlated 1784B  jited 1274B  memlock 4096B  map_ids 38,39,40,37,41,42
        btf_id 105
29: tracepoint  name handle_getdents  tag 97c6fdabf49fbe34  gpl
        loaded_at 2023-09-14T13:55:09+0000  uid 0
        xlated 520B  jited 295B  memlock 4096B  map_ids 42
        btf_id 106
```

Inspect them to confirm:

```shell
bpftool prog dump x id 27 | grep getdents
```

```text
int handle_getdents_enter(struct trace_event_raw_sys_enter * ctx):
; int handle_getdents_enter(struct trace_event_raw_sys_enter *ctx)
```

```shell
bpftool prog dump x id 28 | grep getdents
```

```text
int handle_getdents_exit(struct trace_event_raw_sys_exit * ctx):
; int handle_getdents_exit(struct trace_event_raw_sys_exit *ctx)
```

```shell
bpftool prog dump x id 29 | grep getdents
```

```text
int handle_getdents_patch(struct trace_event_raw_sys_exit * ctx):
```

It can fool `ps` because `ps` is using `getdents` to get processes info.
But it can't avoid detection from other eBPF tools. Or can it? Sounds familiar?

That's another story for another day.

## 0x04 Conclusion

This is a relatively easy challenge compared to previous years.
Very friendly for beginners to get started with eBPF.
It also contains a lot of fun elements, many thanks to organizers.
Looking forward to next year's challenge!
